I found a dataset on the housing prices for the first quarters of 2022 and 2023 in the suburbs and cities of South Australia, Australia. I cleaned it with Python and Jupyter Notebook, uploaded it into a locally hosted PostgreSQL database, and then queried the uploaded dataframe with SQL.

I uploaded the dataset in its raw form.
