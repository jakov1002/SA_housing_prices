I found a dataset on the housing prices for the first quarters of years 2022 and 2023 in the suburbs and cities of the state of South Australia, Australia. I cleaned it, uploaded it into a locally hosted PostgreSQL database, and then queried the uploaded dataframe with SQL.

I uploaded the dataset in its raw form which I then cleaned with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
