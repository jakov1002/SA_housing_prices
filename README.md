1. Found a dataset on the housing prices for the first quarters of 2022 and 2023 in the suburbs and cities of South Australia, Australia. 
2. Transformed and cleaned it with Python. 
3. Uploaded the transformed and clean form into a locally hosted PostgreSQL database
4. Queried the uploaded data with SQL for interesting insights.

I uploaded the dataset in both its raw and clean forms.
